@/*		zre_defs.h
 *	definitions which are only needed by programs that
 *	actually use the ZRE. Some ZRE definitions are in
 *	config.h, as they are needed ny, e.g. the RAM test.
 *	These definitions get into config.h because config.mac
 *	includes zoid20.mac, and config.h is generated from
 *	config.mac automatically. SO--- Don't edit config.h
 *	directly. It will be futile in the long run.
 *
 *	All comments starting with a '?' indicate my guess
 *	as to the meaning of the name/value.
