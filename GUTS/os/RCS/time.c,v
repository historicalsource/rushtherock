@Allowed for dynamic resolution. I.E. AN_VIS_COL et. al. can be made
into ints instead of #defines. On 3dfx systems this is accompolished
by defining the following in config.mac:
DEC_CONST DYNAMIC_VIS_PIX 1
DEC_CONST VIS_H_PIX_MAX whatever
DEC_CONST VIS_V_PIX_MAX whatever
After this, AN_VIS_COL, AN_VIS_ROW, VIS_V_PIX, VIS_H_PIX and
SST_RESOLUTION become "extern int" instead of #defines.
The new #defines AN_VIS_ROW_MAX and AN_VIS_COL_MAX are
created (computed from VIS_H_PIX_MAX, VIS_V_PIX_MAX) so
local arrays can be declared and this is the principle changed
to this file.
