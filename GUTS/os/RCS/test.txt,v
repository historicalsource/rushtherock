@/* This is a test of the RCS variables:
 *
 *
     $Author$
          The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

     $Date$
          The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.

     $Header$
          A standard header containing the full pathname of the RCS file, the
          revision number, the date (UTC), the author, the state, and the
          locker (if locked).

     $Id$
	  Same as \$Header\$, except that the RCS filename is without a path.

     $Locker$
          The login name of the user who locked the revision (empty if not
          locked).

     $Log$
          The log message supplied during checkin, preceded by a header
          containing the RCS filename, the revision number, the author, and
          the date (UTC).  Existing log messages are not replaced.  Instead,
          the new log message is inserted after $Log:...$.  This is useful for
          accumulating a complete change log in a source file.

     $RCSfile$
          The name of the RCS file without a path.

     $Revision$
          The revision number assigned to the revision.

     $Source$
          The full pathname of the RCS file.

     $State$
          The state assigned to the revision with the -s option of rcs(1) or
          ci(1).
